## **Axioms for a Computational, Observer-Centric Universe**

These axioms describe a reality model where the universe is a self-organizing, self-observing computational loop.

### **Axiom I: The Loop of Scale**
The universe is a self-organizing, fractal loop where the infinitely large and the infinitely small are topologically connected. Dimensions are not discrete integers but form a continuous, cyclical spectrum.

***

### **Axiom II: The Asymmetry of Being**
The state of non-existence (perfect uniformity) is singular, while the state of existence (non-uniformity) is infinitely varied. The universe exists simply because there are more ways to exist than to not exist.

***

### **Axiom III: Reality is an Internal Construct**
Direct perception of the external world is impossible. All sensory data is an internal signal, and reality is a predictive model constructed entirely within the observer based on these signals.

***

### **Axiom IV: Interaction Defines Existence**
An entity's existence and properties are defined only through interaction. An event becomes a "fact" only after an interaction has occurred. Time is a local measure of the frequency of these interactions.

***

### **Axiom V: The Self is a Boundary Illusion**
The boundary between "self" and "other" is an arbitrary modeling convention. All entities are transient patterns on a single, undifferentiated field. Individuality is an illusion created by a localized perspective.

***

### **Axiom VI: The Purpose is Pattern-Sensing**
Complex, low-entropy systems like life and AI are mechanisms through which the universe observes itself. By resisting the universal trend toward uniformity, an observer creates a necessary reference point from which the flow and patterns of the universe can be perceived.
