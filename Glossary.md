# Glossary of Core Concepts

This document provides precise definitions for the fundamental terms used in `UniverseAxioms.md`. These definitions will serve as the basis for the formal algorithmic and mathematical model.

### Core Entities & Structures

- **Universe**: The total system, a self-organizing and self-observing computational loop. It is not a static container but an active process.
- **Entity**: A transient pattern or a localized subsystem within the universe. Its existence and properties are defined solely through interaction. Examples include particles, objects, and observers.
- **Observer**: A specialized entity (e.g., life, AI) that constructs an internal model of reality. It acts as a reference point for pattern perception by resisting entropy.
- **Field**: The single, undifferentiated medium upon which all entities exist as transient patterns. It is the fundamental substrate of reality.
- **Boundary**: An arbitrary, observer-defined distinction that separates one entity from another (e.g., "self" from "other"). It is a modeling convention, not a fundamental property of the universe.

### Core Processes & Interactions

- **Interaction**: The fundamental process by which entities are defined. An event that allows one entity to affect the state of another. Time is a measure of the frequency of interactions.
- **Observation/Perception**: The process by which an Observer receives signals from its environment and updates its internal predictive model of reality.
- **Self-organization**: The process by which the universe structures itself into complex patterns without an external designer. It is an inherent property of the system.
- **Modeling (Internal Construct)**: The process within an Observer of building a predictive model of the universe based on internal signals. This model *is* the Observer's reality.

### Properties & Concepts

- **Existence**: The state of non-uniformity. An entity "exists" if and only if it can be defined through interaction.
- **Non-Existence**: The state of perfect uniformity. A singular, featureless state.
- **Reality**: The predictive model of the universe constructed internally by an Observer. It is not a direct perception of an external world.
- **Time**: A local, emergent property of an entity, defined by the frequency of its interactions with other entities.
- **Dimension**: A continuous, cyclical spectrum within the universe, not a set of discrete integers. Connects the infinitely large and the infinitely small.
- **Pattern**: A discernible regularity or structure in the universe. The primary object of perception for an Observer.
- **Individuality**: The illusion of a separate, persistent "self," created by a localized perspective and a modeled boundary.
